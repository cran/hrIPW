        Estimated Propensity Score

Authors@R: person("David", "Hajage", email = "david.hajage@aphp.fr", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimates the log hazard ratio associated with a binary exposure using a Cox PH model weighted by the propensity score. 
  Propensity model is estimated using a simple logistic regression. 
  Variance estimation takes into account the propensity score estimation step with the method proposed by Hajage et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700330>. 
  Both the average treatment effect on the overall (ATE) or the treated (ATT) population can be estimated. 
  For the ATE estimation, both unstabilized and stabilized weights can be used.
